# Sencia Export/Care Feature Migration

This document describes the migration of the care/export functionality from the Rapport folder to the main Sencia application.

## Overview

The Rapport folder contained a complete TypeScript/React application with modern UI components for the care/export functionality. This has been successfully migrated to the main app with the following improvements:

- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper type definitions
- **Modern UI Components**: Radix UI components for better accessibility and user experience
- **Improved State Management**: Custom hooks for better state management
- **Better Code Organization**: Proper separation of concerns with dedicated folders

## Dependencies Added

The following dependencies were added to support the new functionality:

```json
{
  "@radix-ui/react-*": "Various Radix UI components",
  "class-variance-authority": "^0.7.1",
  "cmdk": "^1.1.1",
  "embla-carousel-react": "^8.6.0",
  "input-otp": "^1.4.2",
  "lucide-react": "^0.487.0",
  "next-themes": "^0.4.6",
  "react-day-picker": "^9.1.3",
  "react-hook-form": "^7.55.0",
  "react-resizable-panels": "^2.1.7",
  "recharts": "^2.15.2",
  "sonner": "^2.0.3",
  "vaul": "^1.1.2"
}
```

## Usage

### Accessing the New Export Feature

1. **Via the main app**: Navigate to `/app/export` and click "Essayer la nouvelle version TypeScript"
2. **Direct access**: Navigate to `/app/export-new`

### Development

To run the development server:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```

The new export functionality is available at `http://localhost:5173/app/export-new`

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses React hooks for local state management
- Custom `useAppState` hook for global application state
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

### UI Components
- Built with Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Consistent design system with the original app

### Navigation Flow
1. **Export Choice** → Select export type (practitioner/personal)
2. **Last Appointment** → Enter doctor and last appointment date
3. **Next Appointment** → Enter next appointment date
4. **Loading** → Generate report (simulated)
5. **Complete** → Return to dashboard

## Future Enhancements

The migrated code provides a solid foundation for future enhancements:

1. **PDF Generation**: Integrate with existing PDF generation logic
2. **Data Integration**: Connect with real user data instead of mock data
3. **Personal Export Flow**: Complete the personal export workflow
4. **Report Management**: Add report history and management features
5. **Email Integration**: Send reports via email
6. **Calendar Integration**: Sync with external calendars

## Migration Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support prevents runtime errors
2. **Better UX**: Modern UI components with better accessibility
3. **Maintainability**: Cleaner code structure and separation of concerns
4. **Scalability**: Easy to extend with new features
5. **Performance**: Optimized components and state management
6. **Developer Experience**: Better tooling and debugging capabilities

## Notes

- The original Export.jsx remains functional for backward compatibility
- All new components are fully typed with TypeScript
- The UI maintains consistency with the existing design system
- Dependencies were installed with `--legacy-peer-deps` to resolve React version conflicts
- The migration preserves all original functionality while adding modern improvements
